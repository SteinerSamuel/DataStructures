# Project 3: Linked Based Bag

Write a class LinkedBag, which includes the following operations (the same as the ArrayBag in Project 2)

    •Get the current number of entries in this bag.
    •See whether this bag is empty.
    •Add a new entry to this bag.
    •Remove one unspecified entry from this bag, if possible.
    •Remove all occurrences of a given entry from this bag.
    •Remove all entries from this bag.
    •Count the number of times a given entry appears in this bag.
    •Test whether this bag contains a given entry.
    •Retrieve all entries that are in this bag.

The bag specification "BagInterface.java" is the same file as we provided for Project 2. The test driver "LinkedBagTest.java" is quite similar to the test driver given in Project 2 except minor change for two places. Please read them carefully and complete your class implementation "LinkedBag.java".  The output should be the same as the last project output.
 
A framework of the class implementation is given in the attached "LinkedBag.java". But you need to work out for those 9 class methods.
